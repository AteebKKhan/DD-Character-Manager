# DD-Character-Manager
A Python-based RPG character management system inspired by the systems used in the Dragon's Dogma franchise by Capcom. Built to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and data persistence.

This project is a technical demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming principles in Python. It simulates an RPG character system where the user can manage various aspects of their characters such as stats, vocation, and equipment.

Key Features and Learning Objectives:
Object-Oriented Design: Developed a character class to encapsulate data and behavior via methods.
State Management: Handled individual state for multiple objects simultaneously.
Attributes and Logic: Managed complex attribute sets including level progression and equipment slots.
Future Goal: Implementing JSON serialization for persistant save files. Potentially creating a full Indie RPG game.
